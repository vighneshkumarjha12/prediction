    <h4 class="abba">Lung Cancer</h4>
    <p class="headp">
        Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that
        take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale . Lung cancer is the leading cause of
        cancer deaths worldwide.
        People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer, though lung cancer can also occur in people who have
        never smoked.

    <h4 class="an anm">Small Cell Lung Cancer </h4>

    <p class="headp">
        Small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung. There are
        two main types of small cell lung cancer. Smoking is the major risk factor for small cell lung cancer. Signs and
        symptoms of small cell lung cancer include coughing and shortness of breath
    </p>
    <h4 class="an anm">Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</h4>

    <p class="headp">
        Non-small cell lung cancer is an umbrella term for several types of lung cancers. Non-small cell lung cancers
        include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.

        ⭐ Squamous Cell Carcinoma <br>
        ⭐ Large Cell Carcinoma


    </p>

    <h4 class="abba">Adenocarcinoma</h4>

    <p class="headp">
        Adenocarcinoma is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It usually begins in the outer edges of the
        lungs and the lining of the bronchi (airway passages into the lungs). It is different from other types of lung
        carcinomas, which are usually more centrally located in the lungs. Adenocarcinoma grows more slowly than other
        types of lung cancer and forms smaller masses, but it can also metastasize in its early stages.
    </p>
    <h4 class="an anm">Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h4>

    <p class="headp">
        Squamous cell carcinomas start in squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the inside of the airways in
        the lungs. They are often linked to a history of smoking and tend to be found in the central part of the lungs,
        near a main airway (bronchus).
    </p>
    <h4 class="an anm">Large Cell Carcinoma</h4>

    <p class="headp">
        Large cell carcinoma is a type of NSCLC. The National Cancer Institute state that large cell carcinoma is a type
        of cancer that can begin in several types of large cells. As the name suggests, these cancer cells appear larger
        than typical cancer cells when viewed under a microscope. </p>
